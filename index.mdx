Cuehand is a browser automation SDK that lets you control web 
browsers using natural language and code. Built as a **free** alternative 
to Stagehand and Browserbase, Cuehand was created out of necessity when 
dockerizing  Stagehand proved impossible and unreliable. By combining 
the intelligence of AI with the precision of code, Cuehand makes web 
automation simple and reliable.

## Who Cuehand Is Built For
Cuehand is ideal for anyone who wants to automate browser actions using 
natural language **and** needs to dockerize their automation projects for 
production deployment on platforms like **Railway**.

Does that mean others won't benefit? Not at all. Cuehand can help anyone 
seeking reliable, AI-powered browser automation. My main goal is a bit 
selfish: I built Cuehand to solve the problems I personally faced, and 
I hope it makes life easier for anyone who has faced the same problems.
