## What is `agent()`?
```typescript
await agent.execute("complete this quiz for me and submit it");
```
An agent is an intelligent combination of all the Cuehand primitives. 
It is a way to build a complex task out of simple steps.

### Computer Use Agents
Currently the only supported agent is the Computer Use Agent.
You can use specialized computer use models from either Google, OpenAI or Anthropic.

```typescript
const agent = cuehand.agent({
    cua: true,
    model: {
        modelName: "google/gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025",
        apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY
    },
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant...",
});

await agent.execute({
    instruction:`
        Go to Ollama.com and find the cloud section which will show prices.
        Click on the 'See docs' link next to the download button on the free option.
    `,
    maxSteps: 20,
    highlightCursor: true
})
```
