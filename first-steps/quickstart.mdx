Let's get you up and running with Cuehand in 60 seconds.
It is important to note that Cuehand uses **Typescript**, the **Vercel AI SDK**, **Puppeteer** and **Zod**.

## Prerequisites
If you don't have a project directory, create one and navigate into it.
```bash
mkdir cuehand-project
cd cuehand-project
```

## 1. Create a sample project
Here we use the Cuehand CLI to create a sample project. For this guide just press `Enter` on your keyboard 
for all options to accept the defaults. If you want to learn more about the CLI, see the [CLI](/resources/cli) page.
```bash
npx create-cuehand .
```

## 2. Add your API keys
Follow the CLI prompts and wait for dependencies to be installed. Then copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` to add your API keys.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
`.env.example` contains the following API key:
```env .env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

<Danger>
    Remember to replace the API keys in the `.env` file with your own.
    The project will not work without a valid API key.
</Danger>

You can get your own API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).
Once you have your API key and added it to the `.env` file, delete the `.env.example` file.

## 3. Use Cuehand (act, extract, observe)
The scaffold includes an index.ts file that contains the example script. Here's what it looks like:
```typescript index.ts expandable lines wrap
import { Cuehand } from "cuehand";

async function main() {
    const cuehand = new Cuehand({
        type: "LOCAL",
        model: google("gemini-2.5-flash"),
    });

    await cuehand.init();

    await cuehand.goto("https://www.testpapers.co.za/gr12-subjects");

    await cuehand.wait(3);

    console.log("Extracting subjects...");

    const result = await cuehand.extract(`
        Extract a list of Grade 12 subjects. 
        Each subject should have a name and a link to its page. 
        Subject Example: Business Studies.
        `,z.object({
            subjects: z.array(z.object({
                name: z.string(),
                link: z.string()
            }))
        });
    );

    console.log("Result:", result);

    await cuehand.close();
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## 4. Finally, run it
Run the project using the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

That's it! You have successfully created and run your first Cuehand project. 🎉
