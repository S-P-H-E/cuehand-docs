Let's get you up and running with Cuehand in 60 seconds.
It is important to note that Cuehand uses **Typescript**, the **Vercel AI SDK**, **Puppeteer** and **Zod**.

{/* <Info>This draws attention to important information</Info> */}
## 0. Prerequisites
If you don't have a project directory, create one and navigate into it.
```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

## 1. Create a sample project
```bash
npx create-cuehand .
```

## 2. Run it
Follow the CLI prompts to enter the project directory and add your API keys. 
Then run the example script.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```
<Warning>Remember to replace the API keys in the .env file with your own.</Warning>

## 3. Use Cuehand (act, extract, observe)
The scaffold includes an index.ts file that contains the example script. Here's what it looks like:
```typescript index.ts
import { Cuehand } from "cuehand";

async function main() {
    const cuehand = new Cuehand({
        type: "LOCAL",
        model: google("gemini-2.5-flash"),
    });

    await cuehand.init();

    await cuehand.goto("https://www.testpapers.co.za/gr12-subjects");

    await cuehand.wait(3);

    const result = await cuehand.extract(`
        Extract a list of Grade 12 subjects. 
        Each subject should have a name and a link to its page. 
        Subject Example: Business Studies.
        `,z.object({
            subjects: z.array(z.object({
                name: z.string(),
                link: z.string()
            }))
        });
    );

    console.log(result);

    await cuehand.close();
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});

```
