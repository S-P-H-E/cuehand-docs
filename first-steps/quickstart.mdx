Let's get you up and running with Cuehand in 60 seconds.
It is important to note that Cuehand uses **Gemini** as the default model for AI interactions. 
You can use any other model supported by the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a sample project">
    Here we use the Cuehand CLI to create a sample project. For this guide just press `Enter` on your keyboard 
    for all options to accept the defaults. If you want to learn more about the CLI, see the [CLI](/more-information/cli) page.
    ```bash
    npx create-cuehand .
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your API key">
    1. Navigate to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).
    2. Copy your API key.
    3. Paste your Google AI API key into your `.env` file.

    ```bash .env
    GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Cuehand (act, extract, observe)">
    The scaffold includes an index.ts file that contains basic Cuehand code. Here's what it looks like:
    ```typescript index.ts expandable lines wrap
    import { Cuehand } from "cuehand";

    async function main() {
        const cuehand = new Cuehand({
            type: "LOCAL",
            model: google("gemini-2.5-flash"),
        });

        await cuehand.init();

        await cuehand.goto(
           "https://www.testpapers.co.za/gr12-subjects"
        );

        await cuehand.wait(3);

        console.log("Extracting subjects...");

        const result = await cuehand.extract(`
            Extract a list of Grade 12 subjects. 
            Each subject should have a name and a link to its page. 
            Subject Example: Business Studies.
            `,z.object({
                subjects: z.array(z.object({
                    name: z.string(),
                    link: z.string()
                }))
            });
        );

        console.log("Result:", result);

        await cuehand.close();
    }

    main().catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
        process.exit(1);
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finally, run it">
    Run the project using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! You have successfully created and run your first Cuehand project. 🎉
