The Cuehand CLI is a tool that helps you create and manage your Cuehand projects.

## Basic Usage
Create a new Cuehand project in the current directory.
```bash
npx create-cuehand .
```

## Options and Prompts
The CLI will prompt you for the following information:
```text Terminal icon="terminal"
? Do you want to create a new project or add to an existing one?
(Use arrow keys)
❯ New project
  Add to Existing
```

After selecting **New Project**, the CLI will ask you to select a project type:
```text Terminal icon="terminal"
? Select project type:
❯ Local
  Docker
```
- **Local** - sets up a simple project that runs directly on your machine.

- **Docker** - includes a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment.

If you select **Add to Existing**, the CLI will ask you to select a project:
```text Terminal icon="terminal"
? Select what to add to the existing project::
❯ Cuehand
  Cuehand + Docker
```

## Flags
| Flag | Description |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `--yes`     | Skips all prompts and uses cached values from your last run. |

Example:
```bash
npx create-cuehand . --yes
```
