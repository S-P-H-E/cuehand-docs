Cuehand is a browser automation SDK that lets you control browsers with code 
or natural language. A **free** alternative to Stagehand and Browserbase, it wraps 
Stagehand's API but runs on a Playwright browser instead, offering reliable 
dockerization and opinionated options for specific use cases.

## Who Cuehand Is Built For
Cuehand is ideal for anyone who wants to automate browser actions using 
natural language **and** needs to dockerize their automation projects for 
production deployment on platforms like **Railway**.

Does that mean others won't benefit? Not at all. Cuehand can help anyone 
seeking reliable, AI-powered browser automation. My main goal is a bit 
selfish: I built Cuehand to solve the problems I personally faced, and 
I hope it makes life easier for anyone who has faced similar problems.
