This section covers how to dockerize Cuehand projects for production deployment.
This is useful for deploying Cuehand projects on platforms like **Railway**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Dockerfile">
    ```dockerfile Dockerfile expandable
    # Use the official Playwright image
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.56.1-jammy

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy package files
    COPY package*.json ./

    # Install dependencies
    RUN npm ci

    # Copy source code
    COPY . .

    # Run the application
    CMD ["npm", "start"]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a .dockerignore file">
    Create a .dockerignore file in the root of your project.
    ```dockerignore .dockerignore
    node_modules
    npm-debug.log
    .git
    .gitignore
    .env*
    .DS_Store
    *.log
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a docker-compose.yml file">
    Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root of your project.
    ```yml docker-compose.yml
    services:
      cuehand:
        build:
          context: .
        env_file:
          - .env
        environment:
          - GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY
    ```
    Optionally, if you want to store user data in a volume, you can add the following:
    ```yml docker-compose.yml
    volumes:
      - ./userData:/app/userData
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build and run the container">
    Build and run the container.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

I keep mentioning [Railway](https://railway.com), but you can use any platform that supports Docker.
